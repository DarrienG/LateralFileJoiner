Lateral File Joiner is a very small Java library that allows for basic concatenation operations of files. Originally intended to allow for easy vertical concatenation of files, it has expanded to become a bit more than that.

Lateral File Joiner, in addition to being able to concatenate files laterally, can now concatenate files vertically, and can also add any set number of spacing characters at the end of a file. 

And that's all there is to it. Super easy, super simple. Toss a String of the file names you'd like into the constructor, call the operation you'd like to do, and it will return a string to the newly created file. Simple as that.
